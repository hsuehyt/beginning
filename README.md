# Read Me for HelloWorld Script

## Overview
The `HelloWorld` script is designed to be used within the Unity game development environment, leveraging the Unity UI system and the TextMeshPro package to display a greeting message. This script dynamically displays a greeting to the user, including their first and last names, making it a simple yet customizable tool for introducing UI elements in Unity projects.

## Features
- Dynamically sets and displays a greeting message using the user's first and last names.
- Utilizes the powerful TextMeshProUGUI component for high-quality text rendering.

## Requirements
- Unity 2018.4 or later (though it should work with earlier versions that support TextMeshPro).
- TextMeshPro package installed and set up in your Unity project.

## Installation
1. Ensure that your Unity project is open and that you've installed the TextMeshPro package. If you haven't, you can do so by navigating to `Window > TextMeshPro > Import TMP Essential Resources`.
2. Create a new C# script in your Unity project's Assets folder and name it `HelloWorld`.
3. Open the `HelloWorld` script in your preferred code editor and replace its content with the provided code snippet.
4. Save the script and return to Unity.

## Usage
1. In the Unity Editor, create a new UI TextMeshPro - Text element by right-clicking in the Hierarchy window and navigating to `UI > TextMeshPro - Text`.
2. With the TextMeshPro element selected, attach the `HelloWorld` script by dragging it from the Assets folder to the Inspector window or by using the `Add Component` button in the Inspector.
3. In the `HelloWorld` component in the Inspector, you'll see two fields: `First Name` and `Last Name`. Enter the desired names in these fields.
4. Enter Play Mode to see the greeting message displayed on the screen with the names you entered.

## Configuration
- **First Name:** The first name to be used in the greeting message. This field is public and can be set in the Unity Editor.
- **Last Name:** The last name to be used in the greeting message. This field is public and can be set in the Unity Editor.
